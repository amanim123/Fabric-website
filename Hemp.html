 <h1> Hemp</h1>

    <h2> A natural fabric called hemp is created from the fibers of the hemp plant. 
        Because to its toughness and durability, it is frequently used for industrial 
        applications such sacks, ropes, and sails. In order to make it softer and more 
        pleasant, it can also be used to produce garments, typically by combining it 
        with another fabric like cotton.
