 <h1> Cotton</h1>

    <h2> Cotton is a natural material that is soft, breathable, and washable and is manufactured 
    from the fibers of the cotton plant. It is preferred for a wide range of goods, such as clothing 
    and furnishings items, and is one of the best sewing supplies for beginners. The environmentally
    friendlier, more sustainable variants of this fabric are made from recycled and organic cotton.
