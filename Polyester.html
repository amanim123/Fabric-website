 <h1> Polyester</h1>

    <h2> A synthetic cloth that is essentially made of plastic is called polyester. 
        Because of its strength, stain resistance, resistance to shrinking 
        and stretching, and ease of maintenance, it is frequently used to produce 
        clothing and household items. Since it doesn't breathe well on its own, 
        cotton is frequently used to make clothes.
