 <h1> Leather</h1>

    <h2> leather is made from the chemically strengthened and softened hide of an animal 
        (such as a cow, sheep, pig, or goat). Leather is frequently used to make shoes, 
        backpacks, coats, handbags, and other accessories because it is durable and waterproof. 
        Suede is a soft but not water-resistant form of leather created from the underside 
        of the animal hide. There is also vegan leather, or synthetic leather, which is 
        frequently constructed of PVC. 

        Polyvinyl chloride, a type of plastic, is used to create costumes and flashy, 
        waterproof garments. PVC is frequently used to make vegan leather.
