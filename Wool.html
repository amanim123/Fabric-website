 <h1> Wool</h1>

    <h2> A natural cloth formed from animal hairs is called wool. 
        The most popular type of wool is probably sheep's, but alpaca, yak, and goat 
        wool are also widely used. Wool can be a little irritating, 
        but it is often robust, warm, breathable, and moisture-wicking. 
        Broadcloth is a term you may be familiar with. Describe broadcloth. 
        It's a thick wool fabric that resembles velvet.
