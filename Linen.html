 <h1> Linen</h1>

    <h2> Another natural fabric is linen, which is produced from the flax plant. 
        Although it is typically more expensive than cotton, it is stronger and will most 
        likely last longer. Also, its production is more environmentally friendly. 
        Bedsheets and summer clothes are frequently made of linen.
