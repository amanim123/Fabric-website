 <h1> Satin</h1>

    <h2> In truth, satin is a form of fabric weave that is created by spinning 
        various natural or synthetic fibers to create an extremely glossy, smooth finish. 
        Stylish clothing like evening dresses, bridal gowns, and lingerie or sleepwear 
        are frequently made from satin.
