 <h1> Lace</h1>

    <h2> Lace is a delicate, ornamental fabric that can be created by hand or machine. 
        Its web-like construction features motifs like flowers, butterflies, and 
        abstract patterns. Handmade lace was traditionally used to embellish handkerchiefs, 
        collars, and sleeve openings. These days, lingerie frequently uses machine lace.
